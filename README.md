# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Adelle, and I'm excited to learn how to program
I like videogames, studying languages, mysteries, writing, dungeons & dragons, and watching classic tv/movies
I also love anime and manga and hope to go to Japan one day
Fortunately I can combine my love of language learning with playing videogames to practice my Japanese
